## UI Design

Aether UI is a custom-built interface library written from scratch in Lua. It features:

- Springy toggle animations using `Enum.EasingStyle.Back` for a satisfying bounce
- Smooth tab transitions with slide-in page animations
- Draggable window with spring open and close effect
- Toast notifications that slide in from the right with a draining progress bar
- Hover effects on every interactive element
- Animated sliders with a knob that scales on hover
- Gradient titlebar and dark frosted surface design
